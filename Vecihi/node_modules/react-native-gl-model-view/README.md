# react-native-gl-model-view

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-gl-model-view.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-gl-model-view)
![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/rastapasta/react-native-gl-model-view.svg)

A `<ModelView>` component for [react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), allowing you to
display and animate any Wavefront .OBJ 3D object. Realized with a native bridge to [GLView](https://github.com/nicklockwood/GLView) for iOS and a native bridge to [jPCT-AE](http://www.jpct.net/jpct-ae/) for Android.

Main features:

* Display, rotate, scale and translate textured 3D models!
* Animate with blasting fast 60 fps by using the [Animated API](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animations.html#using-the-native-driver) native driver
* Supports [Wavefront .OBJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) and GLEssentials model formats (iOS)
* Supports [Wavefront .OBJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file), [Autodesk 3DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.3ds), [Quake 2 MD2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD2_(file_format)), [ASC](https://codeyarns.com/2011/08/17/asc-file-format-for-3d-points/) and GLEssentials model formats (Android)
* Supports all texture image formats supported by [UIImage](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/2DDrawing/Conceptual/DrawingPrintingiOS/LoadingImages/LoadingImages.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010156-CH17-SW8)

## Requirements

* Cocoapods (for iOS) - to install the [GLView](https://github.com/nicklockwood/GLView) dependency.

## Getting started

You can install and try linking the project automatically:

```sh
$ npm install --save react-native-gl-model-view
$ react-native link
```

or do it manually as described below:

### iOS Manual installation

`$ npm install --save react-native-gl-model-view`

Afterwards add following lines to your Podfile:

```sh
pod 'React', :path => '../node_modules/react-native'
pod 'RNGLModelView', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-gl-model-view'
```

### Android Manual installation

`$ npm install --save react-native-gl-model-view`

Afterwards, add the following lines to the **android/settings.gradle** file:

```gradle
include ':react-native-gl-model-view'
project(':react-native-gl-model-view').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-gl-model-view/android/app')
```

Finally, add the react-native-gl-model-view project as a dependency of the **android/app/build.gradle** file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    compile project(':react-native-gl-model-view')
    ...
}
```


## Usage

### Model and texture loading

#### iOS

To load a model on iOS, you need to put the file at the root of your Xcode project via the editor.

#### Android

To load a model on Android, you need to place the model in the **android/app/src/main/assets** folder. Create a new folder if it doesn't exist yet.

### Static

```javascript
import ModelView from 'react-native-gl-model-view';

<ModelView
    model="model.obj"
    texture="texture.png"

    scale={0.01}

    translateZ={-2}
    rotateZ={270}

    style={{flex: 1}}
/>
```

### Animated

Make the `<ModelView>`'s native props animatable by wrapping the Animated API around it:

```javascript
import ModelView from 'react-native-gl-model-view';
import { Animated, Easing } from 'react-native';

const AnimatedModelView = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(ModelView);
```

As this usage of the Animated API is *kinda* hacky, you must call the private [__makeNative()](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/Animated/src/nodes/AnimatedWithChildren.js#L24-L35) method on all `Animated.Values` before using `Animated.multiply` and such.

```javascript
constructor() {
    this.state = {
        zoom: new Animated.Value(0),
        // ...
    };
    Object.keys(this.state).forEach(key =>
        this.state[key] instanceof Animated.Value &&
        this.state[key].__makeNative()
    );
}
```

Now you can apply all the Animated API magic to the `<AnimatedModelView>`'s props.
```javascript
render() {
    <AnimatedModelView
        ...
        animate={true}
        translateZ={this.state.zoom}
    />
}
componentDidMount() {
    Animated.timing(this.state.zoom, {
        toValue: -2,
        useNativeDriver: true,
        duration: 2000,
        easing: Easing.bounce
    }).start();
}
```

### Properties

| Prop  | Default  | Type | Description |

| scaleY | 1 | `number` | Scale Y axis by given factor |
| scaleZ | 1 | `number` | Scale Z axis by given factor |
| rotateX | 0 | `number` | Rotate around X axis by given degree |
| rotateY | 0 | `number` | Rotate around Y axis by given degree |
| rotateZ | 0 | `number` | Rotate around Z axis by given degree |

| translateZ | 0 | `number` | Translate Z position by given points |

### Examples

Check out the [example project](https://github.com/rastapasta/react-native-gl-model-view/tree/master/example/src):

* [Usage of the Animated API](https://github.com/rastapasta/react-native-gl-model-view/blob/master/example/src/Animations.js)
* [Using the GestureResponder to control rotation](https://github.com/rastapasta/react-native-gl-model-view/blob/master/example/src/GestureControl.js)
* [Animating multiple ModelViews at once](https://github.com/rastapasta/react-native-gl-model-view/blob/master/example/src/Multiple.js)

To install the dependencies, switch into the `example` folder and set it up as following:

#### For npm < 5

```sh
$ npm install
```

#### For npm >= 5

npm 5 changed the way `npm install` installs and links local modules. Previously, if a dependency in package.json was using the `file: <relative/path/to/file` protocol, npm install would copy the folder inside node_modules as if it were downloading a module from the npm registry. But since npm 5, `npm install` only creates a symlink to the module. Since the react-native packager doesn't work well with symlinks, it cannot find the react module when running the app. A workaround is to install "instal-local", which is a tool made specifically to fix this npm 5 problem:

```sh
$ npm install -g install-local
$ install-local
```

To build and run the app, set it up as following:

## iOS

```sh
$ cd ios
$ pod install
$ cd ..
$ react-native run-ios
```

## Android

```sh
$ react-native run-android
```

## Backlog

* Bridge to [GLModel.modelWithData](https://github.com/nicklockwood/GLView/blob/master/GLView/Models/GLModel.m#L424) to allow flexbile model sources
